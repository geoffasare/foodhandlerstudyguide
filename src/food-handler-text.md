# INTRODUCTION

*A food premises includes a place that prepares and/or sells food*

## Introduction to Food Safety

The food service industry is a big part of the Canadian economy. It includes people working in the many different parts of food service, like restaurants and grocery stores, and factories that process, package and ship food to those restaurants and stores.

It's well known that there's a need for special standards in the food industry because:
- There is a potential for the spread of disease and illness through food
- Customers want to know that the food is safe in the places they buy their food

The first goal of any food premise should be to produce the safest and highest quality food possible. Unfortunately, many of the people working in food premises don't fully understand the risks involved in food service or the need to meet food safety requirements, like personal hygiene, avoiding food contamination and keeping foods at safe temperatures.

### Test Your Knowledge

1. The responsibility for handling food safely belongs to the Public Health Inspector. **FALSE**
2. A Public Health Inspector requires a warrant to enter any place of business to carry out inspections, during normal working hours. **FALSE**
3. Public Health Inspectors enforce the Ontario Food Premises, Reg. 493/17 by conducting routine inspections of all food premises. **TRUE**

## Benefits for Food Premises

A well designed food safety program is good for both the food premises and their customers. Repeat business from customers and higher job satisfaction for employees can lead to higher profits and better service.

Some ways that food premises can benefit are:
- More repeat business from customers who will want to keep going to a place where the food is safe
- Employees being happier with their jobs knowing that the food they are working with is safe
- Lower insurance costs because no claims have been made against their insurance from unsafe food
- Not having to spend money on lawsuits, medical claims or fines for having unsafe food
- Happier customers because handling food safely helps to keep it fresher and better tasting
- Cleaning and sanitizing costs can be kept down if food premises are kept safe
- Not wasting money by throwing away food that was not kept safe
- Not losing money by having to close because of unsafe conditions
- Not having the bad publicity and loss of customers that can happen if food premises are closed by the public health unit

## Food Safety Legislation

The food service industry is regulated by legislation at all three levels of government (federal, provincial and municipal). Legislation set out the requirements that food premises need to follow to make sure their food is kept safe. Some of it is specific to the food, like food handling and storage. Other requirements cover things like the condition of the building and the types of equipment that need to be used. All of these things together are very important, and have an impact on how safe your food is. It is the responsibility of everyone working in food premises to make sure they know the rules that apply to them and to follow those rules.

### Federal

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is responsible for the inspection of food at the federal level.

The CFIA enforces policies and standards, set by Health Canada, governing the safety and nutritional quality of all food sold in Canada. The CFIA verifies industry compliance with federal acts and regulations, including the Food and Drugs Act, through activities that include the registration and inspection of abattoirs and food processing plants, and the testing of products.

### Provincial - Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA)

Each province has its own provincial health acts and regulations. In Ontario, the Health Protection and Promotion Act (HPPA), sets out the mandate to make regulations, programs and protocols which govern food premises. All local public health units are the lead inspection agency for food safety at premises where food is held, prepared and served to the public. It is the responsibility of the food premises owner/operator and employees to ensure they are meeting the necessary requirements.

The HPPA lays out the powers of the medical officer of health and the public health inspector. Some of these are:

**Power of Entry - HPPA (S. 41)**
The medical officer of health or a public health inspector may enter any place of business, during normal work hours, without a warrant, to carry out the duties under the Act. This would include routine inspections or the investigation of complaints of potential health hazards.

**Power of Seizure - HPPA (S. 19)**
The medical officer of health or a public health inspector may seize anything suspected of being a health hazard for laboratory testing.

**Power of Destruction - HPPA (S. 19)**
If a public health inspector determines that food is a health hazard, he/she has the power to destroy or dispose of the food immediately.

**Power to Make an Order - HPPA (S. 13)**
Orders are issued by public health inspectors or medical officers of health to eliminate a health hazard, or to lessen the effects of a health hazard. They are in writing. They may also give instructions orally. Orders may also require a person or persons to stop doing something specific. In the case of food premises, this includes the power to order the premises to be closed until a health hazard is removed or fixed.

### Provincial - PHI

Certified public health inspectors, or PHIs, enforce both the HPPA and the Food Premises Regulation (O. Reg. 493/17) ("regulation") under the HPPA by routine compliance inspections of all food premises. The regulation covers food premises, including cleaning and sanitizing, equipment, food holding temperatures, food handling, employee hygiene in food premises and a requirement for a trained food handler or supervisor on site during all hours of operation.

During inspections, public health inspectors look for:
- Unsafe food handling practices
- Issues of non-compliance with regulations
- Investigation of foodborne illnesses and foodborne outbreaks
- Investigation of consumer complaints
- Action needed on food recalls, fires, floods and emergencies

If any immediate health hazards are seen during an inspection, the PHI could close the food premises and/or issue offence notices (tickets) under the Provincial Offences Act for not meeting the requirements of the Food Premises Regulation.

**There are over 6,500 food premises in Peel Region.**

Another job of public health inspectors is to conduct a risk assessment during the first inspection of each year, and assign each food premises a risk level of high, moderate or low. This will determine if the establishment is inspected a minimum of three times, twice, or once a year, respectively. Low risk food premises that only offer for sale pre-packaged, non-hazardous food may be inspected a minimum of once every two (2) years.

The risk assessment takes into consideration various factors that may increase the risk of foodborne illness, such as the history of compliance, population being served, number of food preparation steps, presence of certified food handlers, and if a food safety management plan is in place.

During the inspection, the public health inspector may also do a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) audit.

### Municipal

Each municipality will have their own by-laws governing their municipality. Municipalities create by-laws to deal with issues that are important to them that are not dealt with at the provincial or federal level. By-laws can be different in each municipality as each area has issues that are unique to their own situation.

Municipal by-laws for food premises cover things like:
- Licensing
- Garbage control
- Sewage disposal
- Building standards
- Zoning
- Smoking and vaping
- Public health inspection result disclosure

Municipal by-laws are enforced by municipal by-law enforcement officers and/or public health inspectors depending on the specific by-law.

## Inspections

When PHIs inspect food premises, they're checking to make sure the HPPA and its regulation is being followed, to keep food safe. Here are some of the things they would be looking for:

**Potentially hazardous foods are maintained at the required temperatures.**
Example: Cooked poultry is stored or held for service outside the danger zone, at 4ºC or below, or 60ºC or higher.

**Food is protected from contamination and adulteration.**
Example: Food displayed for sale or service is protected from contamination by enclosed containers.

**Food contact surfaces can be readily cleaned and sanitized.**
Example: Any article or equipment that comes in direct contact with food is of sound and tight construction, kept in good repair, suitable for their intended purpose, and made of material that can be readily cleaned and sanitized.

**Ensuring good personal hygiene is being practiced by all employees.**
Example: The food handler is clean and wearing clean outer garments while working with food. Food handlers wash their hands after hands are contaminated, before commencing or resuming work, including after using the washroom.

**Cleaning and sanitizing of multi-service utensils to prevent harmful bacteria from spreading.**
Example: Multi-service utensils must be cleaned and sanitized after each use.

**Ensuring that owner/operators are maintaining the food premises.**
Example: All floors, walls and ceilings are readily cleanable, kept clean and in good repair.

**Ensuring presence of a trained food handler.**
Example: During all operating hours, operators must ensure there is at least one food handler or supervisor on site who has completed food handler training.

**Posting results of inspections by the public health unit.**
Example: Operators ensure the results of any inspection conducted by a public health inspector are posted in accordance with the inspector's request.

The Regional Municipality of Peel (the "Region") has created the Peel Inspections Disclosure website to provide the public with past inspection results of all known inspected premises that operate in Mississauga, Brampton and Caledon.

### Benefits of Peel Inspection Disclosure
- Increases public awareness of public health programs
- Improves access to inspection information

Inspection reports can be obtained by:
- Visiting peelregion.ca/health/inspections
- Calling Peel Region Public Health 905-799-7700, or TTY: 1-888-919-7800

## Responsibilities

There are many things to know to keep food safe. The responsibility for safe food belongs to everyone in your food premises, from the owner to the chef to the server to the dishwasher. Every person in your premises has a job to do, and part of that job is keeping your customers and the food you prepare or sell to them safe. As a food handler, it's your responsibility to know what the regulations and standards are and to follow them. You have a responsibility to provide safe food.

# FOODBORNE ILLNESS

*Many people have had a foodborne illness without knowing what was making them feel sick.*

## Introduction

When something you eat or drink makes you sick, it's called 'foodborne illness.' Foodborne illness used to be called 'food poisoning,' but because more foodborne illnesses are caused by infection rather than poison, this has been changed.

When food is contaminated by bacteria, viruses, parasites or chemicals, it can make you sick. Any of these things in food can be called a 'contaminant.'

Every year, a total of about 4 million (1 in 8) Canadians are affected by a foodborne illness (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2016). For most people, a foodborne illness won't be a serious problem. Most will recover in a short time without getting seriously ill. Groups at a higher risk for foodborne illness include: young children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems. For these groups, foodborne illness can be very dangerous and even fatal.

### Test Your Knowledge

1. Eggs and shellfish can cause a serious allergic reaction in some people. **TRUE**
2. It is a good idea to chill glasses in the same ice that will be used in making drinks. **FALSE**
3. If chemicals are put into different, smaller containers or spray bottles, it must be labelled with product name and contents. **TRUE**

## Symptoms

For each reported case of foodborne illness, it's estimated that hundreds of additional cases occurred in the community. When people say they have a '24-hour flu,' it's often really a case of foodborne illness.

Symptoms could include some or all of the following:
- Stomach cramps
- Diarrhea
- Vomiting
- Nausea
- Fever

Symptoms can start soon after eating contaminated food, or they can occur up to a month or more later. How long it takes for the symptoms to begin will depend on:
- What caused the illness
- How healthy the person was before this illness
- The amount of contaminant the person ate

## Causes of Foodborne Illness

There are four causes of foodborne illness:
1. Chemical Contamination
2. Physical Contamination
3. Allergens
4. Microbiological Contamination

A foodborne illness from food contaminated by bacteria, viruses or parasites is microbiological. Bacterial illnesses are the most common type of foodborne illness in Ontario (Public Health Ontario, 2015).

## Chemical Hazards

Some chemicals are added to food on purpose. These include things like salt, spices and colouring. Other chemicals can get into food by accident through cross-contamination. If cleanser is spilled on a counter and not cleaned off and food is then prepared on that counter, the food would be contaminated with cleanser.

Symptoms usually happen fast, from 20 minutes to a few hours after eating the contaminated food. They usually start suddenly with the most common symptoms being nausea, vomiting, abdominal or stomach pain, and sometimes, diarrhea.

**Foodborne illness caused by chemicals is called food poisoning.**

Food poisoning can be caused by:
- Chemicals added to food on purpose, like preservatives or colouring
- Chemicals that aren't supposed to be added to food, like insecticides, rodenticides or cleaning chemicals

### Metal Food Poisoning

Dissolved metal in food can cause chemical food poisoning. If an acidic food, like fruit juice, maple syrup or tomatoes, is stored or cooked in metal containers, the acid can cause the metal to dissolve. Lead, copper, tin, zinc, iron and cadmium are all possible sources of metal food poisoning.

Some ways that food can be contaminated with metal are:
- **Copper beverage lines.** Water can be safely run through copper lines because it won't dissolve the copper. Acidic fruit juice or carbonated beverages will cause the copper to dissolve and it will then be in the beverage.
- **Cadmium in shelving.** If unwrapped meats are stored directly on shelves containing cadmium, the metal can dissolve and be absorbed into the meat.
- **Lead in paint.** Painted dishes or glassware may contain lead which can be absorbed into acidic food.
- **Metal containers.** Acidic foods should never be stored in containers made of metal. Use food grade containers.

### Intentional Additives

According to Health Canada, "a food additive is any chemical substance that is added to food during preparation or storage and either becomes a part of the food or affects its characteristics for the purpose of achieving a particular technical effect." In other words, food additives are things added to colour, thicken, firm or preserve food.

If additives are used correctly, they aren't harmful to most people. They make food look better, taste better and last longer. These are called intentional chemical additives as they're added to food on purpose. But if not used properly or too much is used, a chemical additive can cause food poisoning.

Any food additive can make a person sick if he/she is allergic to it. Three additives well-known for allergic reactions are:
- Sulphites (used to maintain colour and give longer shelf life)
- Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) (used to boost flavour)
- Tartrazine, also known as FD&C Yellow #5 (a yellow food colouring)

### Incidental Additives

Poisonous chemicals like insecticides, rodenticides and cleaning chemicals are sometimes used in food premises. If these chemicals get into food, they can cause food poisoning. This would be called an incidental chemical additive.

For safety, chemicals should be stored in their original containers. If chemicals are put into different, smaller containers or spray bottles, each should go in a clean, dry container labeled with the product name and contents. Proper storage and use instructions should be followed very carefully when dealing with poisonous chemicals to make sure that food is kept safe.

Chemicals should not be stored with food or leave chemical products or cleaning cloths used with chemicals on food preparation surfaces.

## Physical Hazards

Physical hazards are things like dirt, hair, broken glass, nails, staples, bits of metal or any other object that accidentally gets into food. These objects could cause anything from a small cut to possible choking.

To keep this from happening you should:
- Put and maintain protective shields or covers on lights over food storage and preparation areas.
- Remove staples, nails and other objects from boxes and crates when food is received so they don't fall into the food.
- Avoid using glasses to scoop ice, because the glass may break in the ice. Use only commercial, food-grade plastic or metal scoops with handles.
- Avoid chilling glasses or any food items in ice that will be used in drinks.
- Avoid storing toothpicks or non-edible garnishes on shelves above food storage or preparation areas.

## Allergens

Food allergies, or sensitivities to certain food(s), are a problem for many people. Some foods, like peanuts, shellfish or eggs, are very common allergens. Any food can be a risk for a person who is allergic or sensitive to it. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen. In some cases, the time frame can vary up to several hours after exposure.

It's estimated that over 2.6 million Canadians (7.5 per cent of the population) are affected by food allergy. This means that for every 13 people who come in to your food premises, it's likely that one of them has a food allergy.

### Symptoms of an Allergic Reaction

- **Skin reaction:** hives, swelling (face, lips, tongue), itching, warmth, redness
- **Respiratory (breathing):** coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, throat tightness, hoarse voice, nasal congestion or hay fever-like symptoms (runny, itchy nose and watery eyes, sneezing), trouble swallowing
- **Gastrointestinal (stomach):** nausea, pain or cramps, vomiting, diarrhea
- **Cardiovascular (heart):** paler than normal skin colour/blue colour, weak pulse, passing out, dizziness or light-headedness, shock
- **Other:** anxiety, headache, uterine cramps, metallic taste

### Anaphylaxis

Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that can occur quickly and can be life-threatening. Anaphylaxis can start within minutes of contact with the food to which a person is allergic and must be treated immediately. Because an anaphylactic reaction can be severe, people who may have this type of reaction often carry an epinephrine auto-injector (e.g., EpiPen®), which should be administered at the first sign of a reaction. Epinephrine will help reverse the symptoms of the reaction, such as helping with a person's breathing. The person must be transported to the hospital immediately.

**If a customer has an allergic reaction, call 911 or your local emergency service.**

For people with food allergies, the key to remaining safe is avoidance of the foods they are allergic to. Even a very small amount of an allergen, when ingested, can cause an allergic reaction. Because of this, they need to know exactly what's in their food. It's critically important for food service staff to know about food allergies and be aware of how dangerous they can be. Knowing this can save lives.

### Priority Allergens

People can be allergic to any food, but some food allergies are more common than others. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has identified the following foods and additives as most frequently associated with causing an allergic reaction:

- Eggs
- Peanuts
- Sesame seeds
- Sulphites
- Wheat and triticale
- Milk
- Fish
- Crustaceans and Molluscs
- Soybeans
- Mustard
- Tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachios, walnuts)

### Communication

Knowing the ingredients included in all food options is critical when a person with an allergy dines out. Restaurants, fast food outlets and bakeries are not required by law to list ingredients like you see on pre-packaged foods.

Some things the retail food service industry can do to help people with allergies are:
- Ask diners before they order if they have a food allergy.
- Ensure staff know how and where to access ingredient information if requested by a customer.
- Make sure the ingredients used in your menu options are documented and are complete, accurate and up to date.
- Make sure your food doesn't get cross-contaminated by other foods.
- Have an accurate and up-to-date recipe binder or electronic file.
- Avoid introducing new common allergens to recipes, when possible.
- Educate serving and kitchen staff on how to manage food allergy requests or questions (e.g. refer to manager or chef on duty).
- If you're not sure what's in a product, say so. Do not give incomplete or inaccurate information.

**Employees should talk directly to their manager or chef when a customer notifies them about their food allergies.**

### Allergen Contamination

Kitchen and service staff should also be aware of the risks of introducing allergen contamination. Like cross-contamination, allergen contamination happens when food isn't properly separated. Cross contamination can occur by:
- Using equipment that hasn't been thoroughly cleaned and still has other food on it
- Contamination (adulteration) of food, whether on purpose or by accident
- Using rework materials, like using pastry dough for two different recipes that may have come into contact with an allergen
- Using the wrong packages or wrong labels
- Not identifying all ingredients in food received from a supplier
- Using misleading names for foods or ingredients. For example, "Bombay duck" is actually a type of fish
- Carrying too many plates at one time, causing food on separate plates to touch
- Touching different types of food without hand washing in between

**You can prevent contamination that could lead to allergic reactions.**

## Impacts of Foodborne Illness

Foodborne illness doesn't just affect the person who gets sick. The average cost of foodborne illness outbreaks to Canadian taxpayers is estimated to be between $12 and 14 billion every year. Some of these costs are:
- Medical costs, such as doctor's visits, hospitalization and medications
- Investigation costs, like the health unit doing tests to confirm the type of foodborne illness
- Loss of productivity, including sick people missing work, and food premises having to close during an investigation
- Legal and higher insurance costs, if a food premise is sued by those who got sick

## Complaints

If your food premises receives a complaint of a foodborne illness, you should call your public health unit to report any foodborne illness outbreak.

Record the details:
- Who got sick
- What food they ate and when
- What symptoms they had and when
- Write down everything you can about what happened

You should also:
- Talk to your staff
- Ask if any of them have or had the same symptoms
- Ask if any of them were ill when handling food
- Review how the food was prepared
- Save food samples from the meal that was eaten
- Don't give medical advice. Instead, refer to a physician or nurse practitioner.

## Foodborne Illness Summary

- Common symptoms of foodborne illness are stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea and fever.
- How long it takes for symptoms to begin depends on what caused the illness, how healthy the person was before this illness and the amount of contaminant the person consumed.
- The four causes of foodborne illness are chemical contamination, physical contamination, allergens and microbiological contamination.
- Foodborne illness caused by chemicals is called food poisoning.
- Chemical food poisoning can occur if metal is dissolved in food. For example, consider an acidic food like tomatoes stored in a metal container. The acid can cause the metal to dissolve.
- Adulteration or contamination of food can be done on purpose or by accident.
- Physical contamination occurs when hazards like dirt, hair, broken glass, nails, staples, bits of metal or any other object accidentally gets into food.
- Food allergies or sensitivities to certain food such as peanuts, shellfish or eggs can cause various symptoms such as digestive problems, respiratory symptoms, skin reactions, anaphylactic shock and even death.
- Additives are things added to colour, thicken, firm or preserve food, such as sulphites and MSG. Any food additive can make a person sick if he/she is allergic to it.
- The retail food service industry can help people with allergies by avoiding ingredients known to cause allergic reactions when possible, having an accurate and up-to-date recipe binder, avoiding cross-contamination with other foods, making sure customers know how they can get information about the ingredients used and having an emergency procedure available for handling allergic reactions.
- Like cross-contamination, allergen contamination happens when food is not properly separated
- If your food premises receives a complaint of a foodborne illness, record the details, talk to staff about illness and how the food was prepared. Save food samples from the meal that was eaten if it is available.

# MICROORGANISMS

*Microorganisms that make us sick are called 'pathogens'.*

## Introduction

As discussed the last section, foodborne illness can be caused by microbiological hazards, chemical hazards, physical hazards, and allergens. Of these, the most common cause of foodborne illness is microbiological contamination.

To understand how to handle food safely, you need to know a little about microorganisms. Microorganisms are germs that can't be seen without a microscope, but they're found everywhere. These microorganisms can come from food, water, animals, objects and in or on the human body.

Because microorganisms are so small, food that's contaminated with them may look, smell and taste normal, even when it's not safe. So it's very important to know about these microorganisms and how to control them.

### Test Your Knowledge

1. All micro-organisms are harmful. **FALSE**
2. Bacteria do not grow well in acidic conditions. **TRUE**
3. You can tell that food is contaminated with a microorganism by look, taste or smell. **FALSE**

## Types of Microorganisms

There are six main types of microorganisms: viruses, protozoa, parasites, yeasts, mold and bacteria. Some microorganisms are good for us and can be helpful. Some examples are:
- Yeast used to make bread and produce alcohol
- Acidophilus and lacto-bacilli bacteria that help us digest food
- Mold that ripens and flavours cheese (e.g., blue cheese)

Other microorganisms can make us sick. Bread mold, viruses like influenza and hepatitis, Salmonella bacteria and E. coli bacteria are all examples of microorganisms that can be a nuisance, make us sick or even be deadly.

**Microorganisms that make us sick are called 'pathogens.'**

## Viruses

Viruses are found in nearly all life forms, including humans, animals, plants and fungi. They are very small, between 20 and 100 times smaller than a bacterium, and often too small to be seen by a standard microscope. Viruses don't grow in food because they can only grow inside a cell that's alive. They use living cells in our body or in living animals or plants to increase in number.

Viruses that cause foodborne illness are also called enteric viruses, which means they enter the body through the intestinal tract. Symptoms usually start suddenly and last one to two days, but a person may keep feeling weak for several more days. They're very contagious and most times can't be treated, which means a person must wait for the virus to go away on its own. Dehydration is a common problem, especially for people in a high risk group. It's also possible for a person who's infected with a virus to have no symptoms, but to pass that virus on to another person who will have symptoms.

**The best way to control the spread of viruses is hand washing.**

Human hands are the most common way that viruses get into food. This is why hand washing is so important. Another source is contaminated water that can contaminate food washed in it or seafood and shellfish exposed to it. Viruses can also spread through cross-contamination. Three examples of viruses that can be carried in food are Hepatitis A, avian (bird) flu and rotavirus.

Noroviruses are responsible for more than 90 per cent of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis and approximately 50 per cent of all cases cause outbreaks. Many Norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by one infected person. The virus continues to be shed after symptoms have subsided and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection.

## Parasites

Parasites live on or in humans or animals and use them to grow. People can get parasites from:
- Contaminated water or any food washed with contaminated water
- Eating undercooked meat from a contaminated animal
- Cross-contamination

Like viruses, parasites don't grow in food.

**The best way to control the spread of parasites is thorough cooking.**

Symptoms of a parasitic infection depend on the type of parasite. Abdominal or stomach pain, diarrhea, muscle pain, coughing, skin lesions, weight loss and many other symptoms are all possible.

Examples include:
- Trichinosis (pork tapeworm), spread through raw or undercooked pork or wild game
- Anisakiasis (parasitic roundworm), spread through uncooked marine fish and raw fish items such as sushi, sashimi, ceviche or salmon

## Protozoa

There are many kinds of protozoa. The ones that cause foodborne illness are a type of parasite that live in the digestive tract of people and animals.

Protozoa can get into food from contaminated water. They can survive longer in water than bacteria can and they're harder to remove from water than bacteria. Protozoa are more likely than most other microorganisms to infect someone who eats or drinks contaminated food or water.

Cross-contamination can spread protozoa to other food. Examples of foodborne illness caused by protozoa:
- Giardiasis (also known as beaver fever or backpacker's diarrhea) that can spread through contaminated water or food
- Cryptosporidiosis that can spread through contaminated water

## Yeasts

Yeast is used to make breads and alcohol, but yeast can also spoil food. Yeast spoils food by slowly eating it. Contamination shows up as bubbles, an alcoholic smell or taste, pink spots or slime.

Yeast can grow at most food storage temperatures. Yeast usually only spoils food without making people sick. It needs sugar and moisture to survive which it finds in foods like jellies and honey.

## Mold

Molds are needed for some things, like making wines and antibiotics. The blue in blue cheese, the flavour and sweetness of some rare white wines, and the power of penicillin to fight disease all come from different kinds of mold. But the molds we find in our kitchens are the slimy, rotten, fuzzy or unpleasant coloured kind that spoils food.

Single mold cells are usually very tiny, but mold colonies (groups of cells that are growing together) may be seen as fuzzy growths on food.

Some molds make toxins called mycotoxins that can cause serious illness or infections. You can't tell by looking whether the mold you see is one of the poison-producing types.

Examples of toxins produced by molds include:
- Aflatoxin often found in nuts, peanuts and peanut butter
- Ochratoxin A often found in grain, coffee and wine

### When in Doubt

Mold can grow on almost any food at any storage temperature and under any conditions. Freezing prevents the growth of mold but won't kill any mold cells already in the food. The mold that you see on food isn't the only mold that's there. If it creates poisons, they're generally under the surface of the food.

Mold can be thought of like a plant. The part you can see is like the flower. Underneath that are roots inside the food that can make it unsafe. The softer the food, the further into the food the mold is likely to spread.

Does all moldy food have to be thrown out? Some hard cheeses and hard salami can be saved, if you can cut out the mold at least one inch around and under it. However, it is encouraged that all moldy foods are thrown away.

**When in doubt, throw it out!**

## Bacteria

Bacteria are everywhere in our environment. They can be very helpful to us, but they can also be harmful.

Some examples of good bacteria are:
- Lactobacillus and bifidobacterium which help us to digest food
- Biofilms being used by NASA to clean water aboard the space shuttle

Most foodborne illnesses are caused by non-beneficial, or pathogenic bacteria.

**Bacteria illnesses are the most common type of foodborne illness.**

Some examples of harmful bacteria are:

**Campylobacter** - Commonly found in poultry and meat. It can be carried by rodents, wild birds, household pets such as cats and dogs and can also be found in untreated water.

**Listeria** - Found in soil. People can get infected by eating dairy products, vegetables, and fish and meat products that are contaminated with the bacteria.

**E. coli** - Lives in the intestines of animals and can be spread to the outer surfaces of meat when it is being butchered. E. coli can also be spread through contaminated water.

**Clostridium perfringens** - Can be found in high protein or starch-like foods such as cooked beans or gravies and is likely to be a problem in improperly handled leftovers.

**Salmonella** - Most commonly found in raw poultry, but also found in other meats, unpasteurized milk and raw eggs.

### Infection

When food contaminated with living pathogenic bacteria is eaten, it can cause an infection type of foodborne illness. It may take only a small amount of bacteria to cause an infection, depending on the bacteria type.

Bacteria will pass through the stomach and down to the intestines where it'll begin to multiply. Symptoms often take one or more days after eating the contaminated food to appear. With most bacteria, symptoms will appear within three days, but some pathogenic bacteria won't cause symptoms for 10 or more days. Others can take more than two months. Symptoms usually come on slowly and can last for several days. Since this is an infection, one of the symptoms is usually a fever.

The most common examples of this type of food poisoning are Salmonella, Campylobacter, and Shigella. There are many other types as well.

### Toxins

Sometimes it's not the bacteria itself that makes a person sick, but what the bacteria produces. All bacteria produce a waste product, some of which are poisonous or toxic to humans. These waste products are called toxins. A foodborne illness caused by a toxin is also called foodborne intoxication.

These toxins have no smell or taste. Some toxins can't be destroyed by normal cooking temperatures. This means cooking a food contaminated with a toxin may not make it safe.

Bacterial toxins can come from bacteria that's growing in food, or from bacteria that's on a person handling the food. Infections, cuts, burns, boils and pimples all have bacteria and, if those bacteria or their waste products get into food, they can cause foodborne illness.

**Botulism:** Poisoning caused by eating food containing a toxin made by a spore-forming bacterium. Its symptoms are nausea, vomiting, trouble seeing, muscle weakness and tiredness. It can be fatal.

### Toxin Symptoms

Foodborne intoxication symptoms can start the same day or within a day or two of eating contaminated food. They can last up to two weeks. These illnesses can be very dangerous. Remember, a toxin is a poison. One common type is Clostridium botulinum (C. botulinum) that causes botulism.

The symptoms can include:
- Nausea
- Vomiting
- Tiredness
- Dizziness
- Headache
- Double vision
- Dryness in the throat and nose
- Respiratory failure
- Paralysis
- In some cases, death

It's important to remember that with foodborne intoxication, it's not the bacteria that's making the person sick; it's the toxin made by the bacteria.

### Spores

Some kinds of bacteria aren't killed by extreme heat, dryness or chemicals. When they're in conditions where they can't grow, they produce spores. The spore is the resting stage of the live bacteria and it can grow into active bacteria when good conditions to grow are available.

C. botulinum, the bacteria that causes botulism, is one type of bacteria known to produce spores. If an infant eats botulinum spores in food, the spores will grow into active bacteria in the intestine and produce toxins. This can also happen in adults with previous medical problems affecting the intestines.

**Bacterial spores are NOT destroyed by cooking temperatures or most disinfectants.**

## Carriers

Microorganisms can come from food, water, animals or objects. They can also be found in and on the human body. Microorganisms can be present naturally or they can get into food through a carrier.

Carriers are people or things that are carrying microorganisms which can end up in food that's not handled safely. Because microorganisms are so small, they can't be seen with the naked eye and they can be on people and on objects without you knowing it.

People can transfer germs they have into the food they're preparing. It's possible for a person to have an infection without showing any symptoms or signs. In fact, we're always carrying some germs around. Feeling well doesn't necessarily mean you don't have any microorganisms on or in your body.

People can also pick up microorganisms from one type of food and transfer it to another type of food if they don't handle the food safely. This is called cross-contamination.

**Remember, viruses, protozoa and parasites can't grow in food, but they can be transferred to food by a carrier. Bacteria can also be transferred to food by a carrier.**

## Who Gets Sick?

There are a number of things that can make a person who eats contaminated food more or less likely to get sick. Some of these are:

**The person's health before eating the food.**
A person who has a weak immune system is more likely than a healthy person to get sick. Persons with weak immune systems include the very young, the very old, pregnant women, and people immunocompromised by a medical condition.

**The amount of pathogen in the food.**
Campylobacter will generally cause foodborne illness in a healthy person if more than 500 organisms are in the food eaten. For Salmonella, the number is 100,000. For Shigella, a person can get sick from eating as few as 10 organisms. These numbers are called the 'infectious dose.' There has to be enough bacteria to make it through the stomach to the intestines for a person to get sick. Again, if a person's immune system is compromised, it'll take even less.

**The type of microorganism.**
Some microorganisms are more likely to cause foodborne illness than others. Protozoa and parasites are very likely to cause illness if they're eaten.

## Bacterial Growth

What makes bacteria so dangerous?
- They can multiply very quickly at room temperature.
- They can live and multiply in food.
- They aren't killed by refrigeration or by freezing.
- Their spores and toxins may still be dangerous after food is cooked.

Bacteria are carried in water, food and as "hitchhikers" by humans, insects, rodents and objects (such as dishes, towels, and clothing). Bacteria can multiply quickly when they're in conditions that suit them, meaning they have the right temperatures, moisture levels and a food source.

The number of bacteria will double every 10-20 minutes if its surroundings are perfect. The number of bacteria can reach dangerous levels very quickly in a short period of time in this case.

Consider the following key factors that support microbial growth:
- Time and Temperature
- The Danger Zone
- Oxygen
- pH
- Moisture
- Protein

### Time and Temperature

Temperature control is the most effective way to slow the growth of bacteria in food. There's a temperature danger zone for food where bacteria will grow the fastest.

**The danger zone is between 4°C (40°F) and 60°C (140°F).**

It's important to keep food out of this temperature danger zone as much as possible. The longer food is left in this danger zone, the more bacteria can grow and the more dangerous the food can get. Heating and holding food at or above 60°C (140°F) will prevent further bacterial growth but, as we saw before, won't kill bacterial spores and may not get rid of toxins. Chilling food at or below 4°C (40°F) also doesn't kill bacteria or do anything to spores or toxins, but it does significantly slow bacterial growth.

### Oxygen

Some types of bacteria will only grow where there is oxygen and other types will only grow where there is no oxygen. Foodborne illness can be caused by either of these.

Salmonella, bacteria often found in poultry products like chicken, turkey or eggs, needs oxygen to grow.

Clostridium botulinum, bacteria that can be found in improperly packaged cans or jars, only grows where there is no oxygen.

Bacteria that need oxygen to grow are called aerobic bacteria. Bacteria that grow where there is no oxygen are called anaerobic bacteria.

### pH

pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline a substance is. The pH scale ranges from 0-14, with 7 being neutral. Pure water has a pH of 7. Any number below 7 is acidic, and any number above 7 is alkaline.

Pathogenic bacteria need a pH that's slightly acidic or higher on the pH scale. Most foods that we eat are acidic with a pH between 2 and 7.

**pH of some common foods:**
- Lemons: 2.2 - 2.4
- Oranges: 3.1 - 4.1
- Bananas: 4.5 - 5.2
- Bread: 5.3 - 5.8
- Potatoes: 6.1
- Milk: 6.3 - 8.5
- Eggs: 6.0 - 9.0

### Moisture

Bacteria need water to grow. Bacteria will grow faster in moist foods. Moist foods that are good for bacterial growth are things like:
- Meat (steak, hamburger and pork)
- Dairy products (milk and cheese)
- Fish
- Eggs
- Vegetables

Dry foods don't have enough moisture in them for bacteria to grow, but bacteria can survive in them without growing. They can become hazardous when water is added; bacteria in them would then have the moisture needed for growth.

**Low moisture won't kill bacteria, but it will keep bacteria from growing.**

Food can be made safer if the amount of water available to bacteria is lowered by freezing, dehydrating (removing the water) or by cooking. Adding solutes like salt, sugar and preservatives can also decrease the available water in food and can reduce the microbial growth rates.

### Protein

Bacteria grow best when there is a good supply of food or nutrients. The main nutrient for bacteria is protein.

Foods that are rich in protein are:
- Meat (steak, hamburger and pork)
- Fish
- Poultry (chicken and turkey)
- Eggs
- Dairy products (milk and cheese)

Foods that have a high level of both protein and moisture are very good for bacteria growth.

## Potentially Hazardous Foods

Potentially hazardous foods are those that support bacterial growth because they're rich in protein and have high moisture content. These foods need to have their time and temperature watched very carefully to keep bacteria from growing, producing toxins and producing spores.

Potentially hazardous foods include:
- Moist foods with a pH above 4.5
- Dairy products
- Meat, fish, poultry and eggs
- Some raw vegetables and fruit (e.g., bean sprouts, garlic in oil and cut melon), especially those that won't be cooked

Remember, any food that contains one of these foods would also be potentially hazardous. So a cream-filled doughnut, salad with sliced chicken, pasta dish with meat sauce, and casserole with cheese would all be potentially hazardous.

## Microorganisms Summary

- Microorganisms are organisms that can only be seen with a microscope
- Pathogens are microorganisms that can cause illness or disease
- There are six types of microorganisms: Mold, yeasts, parasites, protozoa, viruses and bacteria
- Molds and yeasts are known as spoilage organisms. Some molds make toxins called mycotoxins that can cause serious illness or infections
- Parasites live on or in humans or animals. They can be seen with the naked eye. Parasites do not grow in food
- Protozoa are small parasites that are more likely than most other microorganisms to infect someone who eats or drinks contaminated food or water
- Viruses are smaller than bacteria and do not grow in food because they need humans or animals to grow. Human hands are the most common way that viruses get into food
- Foodborne infections occur when someone ingests food contaminated by bacteria
- Foodborne intoxications occur when bacteria produce a toxin as they grow on food
- A spore is the resting stage of the live bacteria and can grow into active bacteria when good conditions to grow are available. Spores cannot be destroyed by high heat, chemicals or dryness
- Carriers are people or things that carry microorganisms
- Factors for bacterial growth are time/temperature, presence or lack of oxygen, moisture, pH and protein
- The Danger Zone is between 4°C and 60°C (40°F and 140°F)
- Potentially hazardous foods are those that support bacterial growth

# TIME AND TEMPERATURE

*Keep food in the danger zone for as short a time as possible.*

## Introduction

It is important that food be in the danger zone range of temperatures (between 4°C/40°F and 60°C/140°F) for as short a time as possible. This is true during all of the different stages of preparing, serving and selling food.

Food goes through many stages before it's made available to your customers. Steps need to be taken at each of these stages to make sure bacterial growth is kept to a minimum. This is done by controlling the temperatures food is kept at, and the amount of time food is kept at those temperatures.

### Test Your Knowledge

1. Probe thermometers should be recalibrated on a regular basis. **TRUE**
2. All fridges must be equipped with an accurate and easily read thermometer. **TRUE**
3. It is acceptable to thaw raw meat at room temperature as long as it is cooked to the minimum cooking temperature. **FALSE**

## Food Safety Sequence

The basic sequence of food preparation is:
1. Receiving and storage
2. Freezing
3. Thawing
4. Refrigeration
5. Food preparation
6. Cooking
7. Hot and cold holding
8. Cooling
9. Reheating

Not all foods will go through all of these stages and they may not go through them in this order. Fresh vegetables may not get frozen or thawed. Salad ingredients may not get cooked or reheated. All food will go through some or all of these stages. It's very important to monitor and control the temperature of food during all of these stages to make sure bacteria has little chance to grow.

## The Probe Thermometer

To make sure the proper food temperatures are reached and maintained, use a probe thermometer.

- Insert the probe so the sensing area is in the thickest part of the food, or in the centre of the food if there is no part that is thickest.
- Wait at least 15 seconds for the reading to steady and then record the reading.

Probe thermometers must be cleaned and sanitized by using alcohol swabs or a sanitizing solution after each use. This is to make sure you don't cross-contaminate food.

Don't let the probe touch the bottom or sides of the food containers because you won't get an accurate temperature if you do. Never leave the thermometer in food that is being cooked by oven, microwave or stove.

Your probe thermometer must be a food service thermometer. It should have a metal probe; an instant-read type is preferred.

### Thermometer Recalibration

Recalibrating your thermometer regularly will help to ensure your temperature readings are accurate. Recalibrating means adjusting the thermometer to make sure it's reading the right temperature. A thermometer should be re-calibrated:
- After an extreme temperature change
- After it has been dropped

Even if these haven't happened, your thermometer should be recalibrated on a regular basis. The recommended way to calibrate your probe thermometer is by using the ice point method.

**How to recalibrate using the ice point method:**
1. Mix a 50/50 slush of crushed ice and water. The temperature of the mix will always be 0°C (32°F).
2. Set the probe of the thermometer in the mixture, making certain it's not touching the sides or the bottom.
3. Wait until the needle stops moving to see what temperature it's reading. If it's not 0°C (32°F), it needs to be adjusted.
4. If your thermometer has a calibration nut, use a small wrench to turn it until the temperature reads 0°C (32°F). Keep the probe in the ice water to make sure the temperature is accurate.

## Thawing

**NEVER thaw foods at room temperature.** As the food thaws, although the inside of the food is still frozen, the outside of the food will be at room temperature (the danger zone) for a long time allowing any bacteria that is present to grow and multiply quickly.

**Thaw foods safely using one of the following four methods:**

1. **In a refrigerator at 4°C (40°F)** - This method is slow, so allow a day or more for large items, such as poultry and roasts, to thaw. It takes about 10 hours/kg or 5 hours/lb. Whenever possible, this is the method you should use as it's the safest.

2. **In a sink of cold running water** - Use a large clean sink and don't let water splash on other foods or surfaces where food will be, such as counters. Keep the water flowing constantly to keep the outside of the product cold. Remove the food from the sink as soon as it is thawed and sanitize the sink and all utensils used in thawing.

3. **As part of the continuous cooking process** - This method works well for small portions of food like seafood, ground beef and similar foods, but not with large items.

4. **In the microwave** - Use this method only if the food will be moved immediately to another cooking source, because after thawing with this method, the product is warm. This method isn't effective for large items.

**If food has been thawed, don't re-freeze it without cooking it first.**

## Refrigeration

Refrigerated foods must be kept at a temperature of 4°C (40°F) or lower.

Refrigerators need to have their temperatures monitored in the same way as freezers. All refrigerators must have a thermometer that can be easily seen and is accurate. The thermometer should be in the warmest part of the fridge, which is near the door and near the top. Temperatures need to be monitored several times a day to make sure they stay at or below 4°C (40°F). Once a week, a probe thermometer should be used to make sure the temperature showing on the fridge's thermometer is right.

Freezers and refrigerators will run better and keep your food safer if you follow these tips:
- Keep the door closed as much as possible
- Don't overload the space
- Use open wire shelves that have not been lined (no cardboard, tin foil, or other solid material)
- Don't use wood in your refrigerators as it's likely you'll get mold growth
- Make sure door seals are tight and in good repair

## Cooking

Food mixtures that contain hazardous foods should be cooked to an internal temperature of at least 74°C (165°F). Verify the temperature with your probe thermometer for at least 15 seconds.

**Cooking Temperatures:**

| Food Type | Temperature |
|-----------|-------------|
| Pork | 71°C (160°F) |
| Poultry (whole) | 82°C (180°F) for at least 15 seconds |
| Poultry (pieces or ground) | 74°C (165°F) for at least 15 seconds |
| Ground meat (other than poultry) | 71°C (160°F) for at least 15 seconds |
| Fish | 70°C (158°F) for at least 15 seconds |
| Food mixtures containing poultry, eggs, meat, fish or other potentially hazardous foods | 74°C (165°F) for at least 15 seconds |

## Hot and Cold Holding

Holding food means keeping it at the right temperature once it's been prepared and until it's served. Food can be held hot, cold or at room temperature depending on the type of food and how long it's being held.

**Hot holding:** Food being held hot for service or display must be held at 60°C (140°F) or higher at all times.

**Cold holding:** All foods being held cold for service or display must be held at 4°C (40°F) or lower at all times.

Use a probe thermometer to monitor temperatures regularly during the holding time and record them.

## Cooling

If cooked food needs to be cooled for storage or service, it must be done carefully because the food will pass through the temperature danger zone. The food should be placed on ice or refrigerated before it drops below 60°C/140°F. The faster the food is cooled, the less time it spends in the danger zone, and the less risk there is of bacterial growth.

**Cooling foods too slowly is one of the leading causes of foodborne illness.**

**The time it should take to cool food is:**
- Within two hours, the temperature of the food should drop from 60°C (140°F) to 20°C (68°F).
- Within the next four hours, the temperature of the food should drop from 20°C (68°F) to 4°C (40°F) or less.

**Methods to cool food quickly:**
- Transfer hot food to shallow pans (2-3 inches/5-7 cm deep or less)
- Place pans in the refrigerator
- Stir food frequently
- Use an ice water bath
- Use an ice wand
- Add ice directly to the food
- Divide food into small quantities

## Reheating

When hazardous foods are reheated, they need to be brought to their minimum cooking temperature for at least 15 seconds. The food needs to reach that temperature within two hours.

- Foods like soups, stews or gravies should be brought to a boil.
- Food can't be reheated in a hot-holding unit, like a holding oven, steam table or soup urn, because they're not designed to heat food quickly or to high enough temperatures.
- Be careful when using leftovers as they pass through the danger zone twice. Throw out any leftovers after reheating (i.e., don't use the leftovers of a leftover).

**Top 10 improper food handling practices that cause foodborne illness:**
1. Improper cooling, 30%
2. Advance preparation, 17%
3. Infected person, 13%
4. Inadequate reheating for hot holding, 11%
5. Improper hot holding, 9%
6. Contaminated raw food or ingredient, 5%
7. Unsafe source, 4%
8. Use of leftovers, 3%
9. Cross-contamination, 3%
10. Inadequate cooking, 2%

# RECEIVING AND STORAGE

*Make sure food is coming from a safe source and is stored properly.*

## Introduction

Food safety is important during all of the different stages of preparation and production. To make sure the food you're serving to customers is safe, you need to make sure it comes from a safe source and is stored properly.

### Test Your Knowledge

1. Food received at your premises can be accepted if it is not from an inspected source as long as it is in good condition. **FALSE**
2. All delivery trucks are required to have a thermometer in their refrigeration units. **TRUE**
3. Grade C eggs can be used in a food premises. **FALSE**

## Shipping and Receiving

Whenever food is received at your premises, it should be inspected. You want all of the food you're receiving to come from an approved source and be in good condition.

Check delivery trucks. They should be clean and shouldn't have signs of contamination.

All food products should be checked before they're accepted to make sure they're not spoiled or damaged. Look for:
- Proper shipping temperatures
- Dents or rust on cans
- Bulging, leaking or stains on packaging
- Signs that products may be spoiled or infested by pests (e.g., gnawed holes or insect wings)
- Proper labeling and labeling should be intact
- Check the manufacturer's 'best before' date. If the date has passed, don't accept the food.

### Temperatures

Foods that need to be refrigerated or frozen need to be shipped in vehicles that can keep them at the right temperatures. Refrigerated foods must be shipped at 4°C (40°F) or lower and frozen foods must be frozen solid with no signs of thawing.

**Thawing and refreezing are major dangers for frozen foods.**

### Meat, Poultry and Seafood

Only government inspected meat, poultry and fish/shellfish are allowed in food premises. Wrappers and/or boxes of these foods usually show government approval and where the food was packaged.

**Look for government stamps on beef products or tags on chicken and seafood products.**

You should reject meat and poultry products if they're discoloured, have a strange smell, or if the food is slimy, sticky or dry.

Reject fish products if:
- There is a strong 'fishy' or ammonia smell.
- The eyes are sunken or cloudy.
- The flesh is soft and gives (i.e., if you poke the flesh with your finger and the fingerprint stays).
- The shipping temperature is above 4°C (40°F).

### Eggs

Hen eggs prepared or sold in a food premises (such as restaurants) must be from a registered egg station and must be graded.

Always check inside egg cartons. Look for cracks, feathers and/or feces. If you see any of these, the eggs are Grade C and may carry a risk of Salmonella contamination. **Cracked eggs and Grade C eggs can't be used in food premises.** Liquid eggs must be pasteurized and packaging can't be broken or damaged.

Eggs and egg products should be delivered at 1 to 4°C (40°F); and rejected if they're at a higher temperature.

### Dairy Products

Buy only pasteurized milk. All dairy products like ice cream, cheese, sour cream and yogurt must be made using only pasteurized milk. Store most dairy products between 2°-4°C (36°-40°F). Make sure you check the 'best before' date.

### Canned Foods

Food premises can't use or accept any home-canned foods. The risk for botulism is too high.

**Never taste a can's contents to test them. You can get botulism from even one small taste.**

Don't accept any metal cans with swollen sides or ends, flaws in the seams, rust, dents, leaks or bad smelling contents. Reject any can without a label. After a metal can is opened, it must not be re-used to store or cook foods.

## Storage Guidelines

- Your storage areas need to be kept clean.
- All food products should be kept at least 15 cm (six inches) off the floor.
- Chemicals and food must never be stored together.
- All foods should be stored in food grade containers that are of good quality and easy to clean.
- Food should not be crowded.
- Keeping moisture low will help food last longer and prevent mold.

**Always store food in an area that's used only for food storage.**

Never store food in:
- Washrooms
- Staff dressing rooms
- Corridors
- Furnace rooms

## Stock Rotation

All foods stored in the freezer, refrigeration unit or dry storage should be arranged using the **first in, first out (FIFO) rule.** Sort foods by their expiration or 'best before' dates. Products without these dates should be dated when they're received. New products should be put behind older products to make sure that older products are used first.

# MICROBIOLOGICAL CONTAMINATION

*If you think there's a chance that food has been contaminated, throw it away or let your supervisor know.*

## Introduction

Microbiological contamination is the spread of harmful microorganisms to food that doesn't naturally contain those microorganisms.

### Test Your Knowledge

1. It is acceptable to dip your clean finger in food to taste it. **FALSE**
2. It is acceptable to store dry goods in a corridor if there is a lack of space as long as it is kept clean and sanitary. **FALSE**
3. It is acceptable to re-use single-use-utensils such as spoons if they appear not to have been used. **FALSE**

## Cross-Contamination

Cross-contamination happens in three ways:

1. **Food to Food.** Raw food or juices come in contact with ready-to-eat food.
2. **Equipment to Food.** The same equipment is used with raw and ready-to-eat food without cleaning and sanitizing in between.
3. **People to Food.** Hands that have touched raw food then touch ready-to-eat food without being washed in between.

### Refrigerator Storage

When food is stored in a refrigerator, it's important to place the food in a way that avoids cross-contamination.

- Keep raw meat, poultry and seafood on the **bottom shelves**.
- Cooked and ready-to-eat foods should go on the **upper shelves**.
- Raw fruits and vegetables and foods that will be re-heated belong in the **centre**.

Make sure that all stored foods are covered to avoid cross-contamination from drippings or juices from other foods, and to keep out other contaminants like dust or objects.

### Food Display

Old food should never be mixed with new food. The old food may spoil faster than the new food, contaminating the new food.

**You should always use new utensils and new food pans when replacing food on display.**

Each time a pan of food is replaced, the pan and all utensils used with it should be sent for dish washing. Clean and sanitized utensils should go out in their place. "Sneeze guards," which are the protective shields that sit between a person's face and the food on display, should always be used.

### Discarding

Any food that has been served but not eaten must be thrown out. Single service items such as disposable plates, plastic cutlery or chopsticks must be discarded. Even if they look like they haven't been used, you can't know that for sure, so you must throw them out.

### Equipment Care

To help prevent equipment cross-contamination you should:
- Keep sanitizing solution on hand in a bucket or labeled spray bottle, mixed to the proper strengths.
- Keep wiping cloths in sanitizing solution to keep bacteria from growing on the cloth.
- Replace cutting surfaces if they have cracks, crevices or open seams.
- Meat slicers must be taken apart and thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after use.
- Change utensils (i.e., knives, ladles, tongs, etc.) often throughout the day.
- Can opener blades must be cleaned regularly.

### Tasting Food

**When you're tasting food, you need to make sure the microorganisms in your mouth and on your fingers don't end up in the food.**

Do:
- Use a disposable spoon and throw it out right after you have tasted the food.
- Use a clean regular spoon and place it with the dirty dishes right after you have tasted the food.
- Ladle food into a cup, tasting bowl or another spoon. Use a second spoon to taste the food.

Don't:
- Dip your fingers into the food then into your mouth.
- Put a spoon that has been in your mouth back into the food.

# PERSONAL HYGIENE

*Avoid wearing hand jewelry. Rings, bracelets and wrist watches can trap dirt, making thorough hand washing harder.*

## Introduction

People are one of the major sources of microorganisms that cause foodborne illness. There are microorganisms on and in the body (e.g., on hands, face, hair) and on clothes. These microorganisms are there all of the time, not just when a person is feeling ill.

### Test Your Knowledge

1. You do not have to wash your hands after you sneeze as long as you contain it with a tissue. **FALSE**
2. Human hair can be a problem both as physical contamination and microbial contamination. **TRUE**
3. When wearing gloves, hands do not have to be washed after use. **FALSE**
4. A person who has diarrhea can handle food as long as they practice proper handwashing. **FALSE**

## Uniforms, Clothing and Aprons

The Food Premises Regulation requires all employees in food premises to wear clean outer clothing when they'll be handling food. Light coloured clothing is recommended because it's very easy to see when the clothing gets dirty.

Remember, dirty clothing may carry pathogens. When a food handler's clothing or apron looks dirty, get it changed for a clean one immediately.

## Hair

Human hair can be a problem both as physical contamination and microbial contamination. Headgear, such as hats or hairnets, will help to keep hair out of food and off of food contact surfaces. Headgear also helps to keep people from touching their hair and contaminating their hands.

Hair also carries microorganisms, some of which may be pathogens, so hair must be kept out of food to prevent foodborne illness. It's also important to keep your hands from touching your hair when preparing food or handling food contact surfaces or utensils.

Food handlers are required by the Food Premises Regulation to take reasonable precautions to ensure food is not contaminated by hair. This could include wearing headgear that confines their hair.

## Hands and Nails

Hands can pick up germs very easily. Hands need to be cleaned well to keep dirt and germs from being transferred to food. Pay extra attention to your fingernails.

- Use a personal nylon nail brush to clean under nails.
- Keep nails well-trimmed to help them stay clean.
- Avoid nail polish as it could chip and fall into food.
- Protect and care for hangnails to prevent infection.

## Hand Washing

Hand washing, when done correctly, is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of communicable diseases. That includes foodborne illness. Food handlers must wash their hands when needed and wash them well whenever they do.

- Always wash your hands before you start work.
- Wash before handling any food, or cleaning dishes and utensils.
- Any time your hands get dirty or contaminated with germs or with other types of food, you must wash them.

### How to Wash Hands - The Six Steps

1. **Wet Hands.** Remove jewelry and watches. Wet hands with warm water first.
2. **Soap.** Be sure to use enough liquid soap.
3. **Lather well.** Lather for 15-20 seconds. Clean wrists, palms, back of hands and between fingers.
4. **Rinse.** Rinse with warm water. Be sure not to touch the side of the sink.
5. **Dry.** Dry hands completely with paper towel or with an air dryer.
6. **Keep clean.** Use a paper towel to turn off the water to protect hands from getting dirty again.

### When to Wash Hands

You must wash your hands after:
- Using the washroom
- Touching your nose or mouth
- Coughing or sneezing
- Handling raw foods
- Clearing tables
- Handling dirty dishes

### Cough or Sneeze

Coughs and sneezes send microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, into the air where they can be breathed in by other people. You should contain any sneezes or coughs with tissue paper and wash your hands at the hand sink immediately afterwards. If you don't have a tissue handy, cough or sneeze into your upper sleeve instead of your hands. Don't use a cloth handkerchief.

## No-Touch Techniques

Food handlers should avoid directly touching food whenever possible. Utensils like tongs, spoons and scoops act as barriers between your hands and the food. Napkins or sheets of waxed paper can be used to pick up foods like muffins, donuts, cookies, bread, and ice cream cones without directly touching the food with your hands.

**Remember, glove use doesn't eliminate the need for hand washing. Be sure to wash hands before and after gloving.**

Disposable plastic gloves can be used instead of bare hands, but gloves will pick up microorganisms the same way hands do. Make sure you wash your hands before and after using gloves, and always use a new pair of disposable plastic gloves when you change tasks or after any potential contamination.

### When You Need Gloves

If you have a cut or infection on your hand, a bandage should be worn to cover it and a glove should be worn over the bandaged hand until the cut or infection heals. A bandage alone is not enough.

## When You're Sick

If you're sick, your body is producing more germs and microorganisms than it does when you're healthy. If you have any of the following symptoms you must not prepare or serve food:
- Diarrhea
- Vomiting
- Fever
- Sore throat
- Persistent coughing or sneezing

If you have any of these symptoms or if you have a communicable disease, you must let your manager or supervisor know.

**You shouldn't return to work until 24 hours after the symptoms have stopped.**

# CLEANING AND SANITIZING

*It's important to mix chemicals properly. Not using enough chemical will mean microorganisms are not being killed; using too much can lead to chemical contamination.*

## Introduction

Keeping your food premises clean isn't only about it looking good. It's about cleaning and sanitizing to control microorganisms and keep your food and your customers safe.

Destroying all microorganisms is nearly impossible, but by cleaning and sanitizing it's possible to reduce them to safe levels. To do this, both steps are needed and both must be done properly.

### Test Your Knowledge

1. If a cutting board has significant cracks or scratches, it must be replaced. **TRUE**
2. Once properly washed and sanitized, dishes should be dried with a dish-towel. **FALSE**
3. Multi-use service utensils such as plates and cups may be manually washed in a two compartment sink. **FALSE**
4. When not in use, a handwash sink can be used to wash small amounts of utensils. **FALSE**
5. Cleaning schedules are a good practice to use. **TRUE**

## How to Clean

When you clean, use the right chemicals and friction to remove dirt or soil.

The steps to cleaning are:
- Remove any obvious pieces of food, dirt or other debris.
- Use cleaning chemicals and friction to remove the rest.
- Rinse with hot tap water to remove cleaning chemicals.

When it comes to food contact surfaces like counters, dishes, cutting boards or utensils, cleaning alone isn't enough. A surface can look clean but still have unsafe levels of microorganisms. Once a food contact item is clean, the next step is to sanitize it.

## How to Sanitize

When you sanitize, you reduce the number of microorganisms to safe levels.

The steps to sanitizing:
- Always clean before sanitizing.
- Use very hot water, at least 77°C (170°F), or chemicals to remove microbiological contaminants.
- Make sure the items you're sanitizing are in contact with the chemical solution or hot water for at least 45 seconds.
- Use test reagents, test strips or a thermometer to make sure your sanitizer or sanitizing solution is working.

## Types of Chemical Sanitizers

**Chlorine-based products - Strength: 100 parts per million (ppm)**
The most common one is household bleach. To make 100ppm chlorine sanitizer, mix 2 ml of (5 per cent strength) bleach per litre of water.

**Quaternary ammonium-based products - Strength: 200 ppm**
Measure according to the manufacturer's label. You may need to rinse any food contact surface after sanitizing with ammonium. These are also referred to as "Quats" or "quat sanitizers".

**Iodine-based products - Strength: 25 ppm**
Mix according to the manufacturer's label instructions.

## Three Compartment Sink Dishwashing

If you're washing multi-service articles (e.g., reusable dishes, knives, forks, spoons, glasses) you need three sinks.

1. **Scrape or pre-rinse.** Remove any leftover food on the dishes by scraping or rinsing it off.
2. **Wash (sink 1).** Wash and scrub the dishes, utensils and pots, making sure all food and grease are removed. Use warm water and detergent.
3. **Rinse (sink 2).** Rinse to remove the soap and any remaining food particles. Use clean water, at least 43°C (110°F).
4. **Sanitize (sink 3).** Sanitize by submerging dishes in hot water at least 77°C (170°F), or a chemical solution in water at least 24°C (75°F). Let them soak for at least 45 seconds.
5. **Air dry.** Let items air dry on a non-porous sloped draining board. Never towel dry.

## Two Compartment Sink Dishwashing

You can wash and rinse in one sink, and sanitize in the second. This method can be used:
- If you use single-service disposable dishes
- For cleaning and sanitizing items other than multi-service articles, such as pots and pans too large for a mechanical dishwasher

## Mechanical Dishwashing

**High temperature machine:** Water temperature in the rinse cycle must reach 82°C (180°F) or higher and last for at least 10 seconds.

**Low temperature machine:** Uses chemical sanitizers in the rinse cycle. Test strips must be available to make sure the machine is sanitizing properly.

**All machines must have gauges that show wash and rinse temperatures.**

**Always wash your hands before handling clean dishes.**

## Handwash Sink

Food premises need to have at least one sink that is used only for hand washing. This sink needs to be in an area that is convenient for employees.

At a minimum, each hand washing sink needs to have:
- Hot and cold water
- Soap or detergent in a dispenser
- Clean, single use towels or a cloth roller towel AND a supply of paper towels

**Handwash sinks can only be used for hand washing.**

The handwash sink can't be used for any food preparation, washing dishes, emptying out water from pots or cleaning buckets.

## Live Animals

Live animals are not permitted in food premises. There are exceptions to this rule:
- Service animals (e.g., seeing eye dogs)
- Live aquatic species in sanitary tanks such as fish or lobsters
- Live birds or animals offered for sale with permission from the local medical officer of health

# PEST CONTROL

*Their greatest threat is that they spread diseases by contaminating food.*

## Introduction

Insects and rodents are more than just a nuisance in a food premises. Pests can contaminate your food supplies. They can damage your building by causing electrical or fire hazards and creating holes in the building structure.

### Test Your Knowledge

1. Keeping pests from infesting your premises is much easier and less expensive than getting rid of pests that are already there. **TRUE**
2. Chemicals can be sprayed during food preparation as long as a licensed pest control company is hired to do it. **FALSE**
3. Flies are only a nuisance; they do not pose a health hazard. **FALSE**
4. It is required to maintain records of all pest control measures taken. **TRUE**

## Cockroaches

Once you have cockroaches, you'll find it very hard to get rid of them. Live roaches can survive on very little food and water. They can live for up to two years during which the female roach can lay over 500 eggs.

**If you see cockroaches in a lit up area, it usually means you have a serious cockroach infestation.**

Cockroaches can live and breed almost anywhere that is dark, warm, moist, and hard to clean.

**The #1 reason for closure of food premises is pest infestation.**

## Flies

Flies are attracted by smells. They breed in garbage and feces. A female housefly can lay between 375 to 750 eggs over its life span and eggs laid will hatch in as little as seven days.

Flies easily spread filth because their bodies are covered in hair and their feet have suction cups. Any contaminants they touch get stuck to them.

## Rodents

Rodents, like rats and mice, eat and ruin food and damage property. Both rats and mice can damage buildings. They can make walls weak by chewing holes, and even cause fires by chewing through electrical wires.

Like cockroaches, rodents are active in the dark and at night. If you see them in daylight or well lit areas, it's a sign of heavy infestation.

## Prevention and Control

**Keeping pests from infesting your premises is much easier and less expensive than getting rid of pests that are already there.**

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM)

Three common sense rules for developing an IPM program are:
1. Deny pests food, water and shelter by following good sanitation and housekeeping practices.
2. Keep pests out of the food premises by pest-proofing the building.
3. Work with a licensed pest control company.

### Pest Proofing

Do:
- Seal gaps, cracks and openings in floors, walls and equipment.
- Repair any leaky plumbing.
- Keep the outside of the building in good repair.
- Use screens to cover windows, doors and vents.
- Install heavy plastic strips or air curtains on receiving doors.

Don't:
- Don't have a water source for pests. Drain sinks and repair leaky pipes.
- Don't leave doors open when you're not using them.

### Control Methods

- Cover all food and dishes in areas where chemicals will be sprayed before spraying starts.
- Thoroughly clean and sanitize all food contact surfaces and equipment before using them for food preparation.
- **NEVER spray while food preparation is going on.**

# FOOD SAFETY MANAGEMENT

## Introduction

HACCP stands for Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point. It's a self-inspection system designed to control physical, chemical, biological and allergen contamination at all points in food processing.

**The goal of the HACCP system is to eliminate or reduce the incidence of foodborne illness and prevent food adulteration.**

### Test Your Knowledge

1. A food safety management system takes the place of cleaning and sanitizing. **FALSE**
2. A food safety management system guarantees safe food. **FALSE**

## The Seven Principles of HACCP

1. Conduct a hazard analysis.
2. Determine the Critical Control Points (CCPs).
3. Establish critical limit(s).
4. Establish a system to monitor control of the CCPs.
5. Establish the corrective action to be taken when monitoring indicates that a particular CCP isn't under control.
6. Establish procedures for verification to confirm that the HACCP system is working effectively.
7. Establish documentation concerning all procedures and records appropriate to these principles and their application.

### Step 1 - Hazard Analysis

Identify any potential hazards in your food processing or preparation, determine how critical each hazard is, and determine how likely each hazard could happen.

### Step 2 - Critical Control Points

A Critical Control Point (CCP) is any point during food preparation or production where food safety could be at risk.

### Step 3 - Critical Limits

For each CCP, a critical limit should be set. Example: Chicken parts should be cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 74°C (165°F) to kill Salmonella bacteria.

### Step 4 - Monitoring

At each CCP, the system needs to be monitored to make sure the critical limits are in effect.

### Step 5 - Corrective Action

Corrective actions explain what to do if monitoring shows the critical limits aren't being met.

### Step 6 - Verification

Verification is a double check to make sure the HACCP system is working.

### Step 7 - Documentation

HACCP documentation refers to the policies, procedures and other documents. Records are created when the HACCP procedures are followed.
